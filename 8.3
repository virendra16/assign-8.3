Task 1 Explain in brief the architecture of Apache Hadoop Yarn.

YARN Infrastructure (Yet Another Resource Negotiator) is the framework responsible for providing the computational resources 
needed for application executions.
Two important elements are:
The Resource Manager (one per cluster) is the master.
the location of the slaves is known to it. 
 services are run, the most important is the Resource Scheduler which decides how to assign the resources.
The Node Manager  is known to be the  slave of the infrastructure. 
When it starts, it announces himself to the Resource Manager then  it  an heartbeat is sent to the Resource Manager. 
Each Node Manager offers some resources to the cluster. 
Its resource capacity is the amount of memory and the number of vcores. 
At run-time, the Resource Scheduler will decide how to use this capacity: 
a Container is a fraction of the NM capacity and it is used by the client for running a program.
In YARN, there are at least three actors:
->	the Job Submitter (the client)
->	the Resource Manager (the master)
->	the Node Manager (the slave)
The application startup process is the following:
1)	a client submits an application to the Resource Manager
2)	the Resource Manager allocates a container
3)	the Resource Manager contacts the related Node Manager
4)	the Node Manager launches the container
5)	the Container executes the Application Master
The Application Master is responsible for the execution of a single application.
It asks for containers to the Resource Scheduler (Resource Manager) and executes specific programs  on the obtained containers.
the application logic is known to the application master and thus it is framework-specific. 
The MapReduce framework provides its own impleme ntation of an Application Master.
